This is still being worked on semi-actively, progress updates are posted in the [roadmap](https://github.com/ABCxFF/diepindepth#roadmap)

# **:DiepInDepth**

Collection of protocol, memory, and other hacky information for the browser game [diep.io](https://diep.io/).

What started off as an attempt to parse game leaderboards out of packets is now a collection of information about the insides of diep.io. Including information such as packet encoding/decoding, packet protocol, memory structures, a bit of physics, wasm parsing, game code reversal, and much more.

### **Sections**

There are 5 sections that divide up the information collected.

1. Game Protocol ([`protocol/`](./protocol/))  
   Including incoming and outgoing packets, encoding/decoding, m28 server list api and websocket connections
2. WebAssembly Reversal ([`wasm/`](./wasm/))  
   Including any means necessary, asm.js conversion, specific functions, automation of reversing constants and pointers, understanding of emscripten
3. Canvas Reversal ([`canvas/`](./canvas/))  
   Including shape sizes, draw sequences, scaling, and color constants.
4. Memory Management ([`memory/`](./memory/))  
   Including storage of entities, tanks, the gui, and the structure and way things are stored
5. Extras ([`extras/`](./extras/))  
   Including any extra information, fun facts, misc algorithms, and any physics not provided in [Spade Squad](http://spade-squad.com)

Before going to in depth into entity related memory and protocol, it is highly recommended you read [`entities.md`](./entities.md) to understand how entities work.
