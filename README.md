# **:DiepInDepth**

Largest and most accurate collection of information on the browser game [diep.io](https://diep.io/).

What started off as an attempt to parse game leaderboards out of packets is now a collection of information about the insides of diep.io. Including information such as packet encoding/decoding, packet protocol, memory structures, physics, wasm parsing, game code reversal, physics, and much more.

### **Sections**

There are 4 sections that divide up the information collected.

1. Packet Protocol (`/packets`)
   Including incoming and outgoing, packet encoding/decoding, and headless connection
2. WebAssembly Reversal (`/wasm`)  
   Including any means necessary, asm.js conversion, specific functions, automation of reversing constants and pointers, understanding of emscripten
3. Memory Management (`/memory`)  
   Including storage of entities, tanks, the gui, and the structure and way things are stored
4. Extras (`/extras`)  
   Including any extra information, fun facts, misc algorithms, and any physics not provided in [Spade Squad](http://spade-squad.com)
