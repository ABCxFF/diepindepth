This is still being worked on semi-actively, progress updates are posted in the [roadmap](https://github.com/ABCxFF/diepindepth/projects/2)

# **:DiepInDepth**

Collection of protocol, memory, and other hacky information for the browser game [diep.io](https://diep.io/).

What started off as an attempt to parse game leaderboards out of packets is now a collection of information about the insides of diep.io. Including information such as packet encoding/decoding, packet protocol, memory structures, a bit of physics, wasm parsing, game code reversal, and much more.

### **Sections**

There are 6 sections that divide up the information collected.

1. Game Protocol ([`protocol/`](./protocol/))  
   Including incoming and outgoing packets, encoding/decoding, m28 server list api and websocket connections
2. WebAssembly Reversal ([`wasm/`](./wasm/))  
   Including any means necessary, asm.js conversion, specific functions, automation of reversing constants and pointers, understanding of emscripten
3. Canvas Reversal ([`canvas/`](./canvas/))  
   Including shape sizes, draw sequences, scaling, and color constants
4. Memory Management ([`memory/`](./memory/))  
   Including storage of entities, tanks, the gui, and the structure and way things are stored
5. Extras ([`extras/`](./extras/))  
   Including any extra information, fun facts, misc algorithms, and any physics not provided in [Spade Squad](http://spade-squad.com)
6. Media ([`media/`](./media/))  
   Including screenshots and other forms of media relating to our research in diep
7. Physics ([`physics/`](./physics/))  
   Including information regarding the properties and nature of of entities, such as movement, collisions, and sizes

Before going too in depth into entity related memory and protocol, it is highly recommended you read [`entities.md`](./entities.md) to understand how entities work.
