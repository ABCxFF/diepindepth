# Shape Sizes

The shapes are not drawn by side length. They are drawn by radius (from the center to any of the vertices).

The following is the collected data:

- grid square side length = 50 diep units
- square, triangle = 55 diep units
- pentagon = 75 diep units
- small crasher = 35 diep units
- big crasher = 55 diep units
- alpha pentagon = 200 diep units

## Note

All data here are directly taken from the canvas, not from any server packets, except for the grid square side length.
