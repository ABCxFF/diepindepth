# **WebAssembly**

WebAssembly (wasm) is what [diep.io](https://diep.io/) uses. The way it is written is by a compiler. The code that is compiled often in c++ (what diep's source code is in) or c. 

### **The Compiler**
Wasm is usually compiled by an open-source software known as [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten). It outputs a wasm file, a wasm.js file, and an HTML file. The wasm.js file is known as a "js wrapper."
