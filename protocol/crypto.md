# Packet Encoding and Decoding

Also known as shuffling/unshuffling, this encryption system is what annoys 80% of all the people who deal with diep protocol. No one has fully reverse engineered every part of the encryption system, but ShÃ¤dam got close, and was able to reverse engineer (for the most part) packet opcode/header encodings, and content encodings. Some of his old code is visible on repos in his account.

There are 3 parts to packet encryption:
1. Magic Number and Jump Table `(name change pending)`
2. Packet Content Encryption
3. Packet Header Encryption
4. Encryption Cycle Reset `(name change pending)`

## Magic Number and Jump Table

> Discuss where the jump tables are in the memory, where the magic number is in the memory

## Packet Content Encryption

> the *n* length xor tables, how they're genereated

## Packet Header Encryption

> the jump tables

## Encryption Cycle Reset

> Not sure
